<h1>Uniform Renamer</h1>

<p>Do
you watch your downloads gradually
increase in number, but their file
names are all in different formats. You may occasionally spend some
time renaming
them, but not only does it take a long time, it always feel like a
waste of time. This renamer is designed to cut your organizing time.</p>

<p>The aim of this software is to unify the folders and archive
file names. It's not for batch renaming a group of images.</p>
<p>It is written
in C#, so .Net framework is required. It comes with English/Chinese/Japnese interfaces.<br>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>The rename process consists of a series of steps. There are 3 types
of steps:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Delete</li>
  <li>Copy</li>
  <li>Replacement</li>
</ol>

<p>In the upper half of the window you can edit the step table.
The lower half is the filename preview area, where you
can&nbsp;select&nbsp;files to rename.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

<p><img style="width: 594px; height: 260px;" alt="" src="tut1.png"><br>
</p>

<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">delete step</span>&nbsp;deletes
text from the old file name, which helps to
remove unwanted information. This will make other steps easier. Please
enter the match patterns in the last column. Multiple terms need to be
tab-separated.</p>

<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">copy&nbsp;step</span> copies
text
from the old file name to the new file
name. Please enter the match patterns in the last column for those
words (terms should also be tab separated), and specify the
destination tag in the third column (such as
&lt;volumn_number&gt;). If
there are a number of matches, only the first
match will be copied into the new file name.</p>

<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">replace step</span> searches in
the
old file name for some match, and if one is found, a replacement text
will be inserted into the new file name. For
example, if the old file name to find the words <span style="font-style: italic;">'English'</span>, the program can
automatically place <span style="font-style: italic;">'[EN]'</span> in
the new file name. Please
enter the match patterns in the last column, the replacement text in
the fourth column,
and the destination tag in the third column.</p>

<p>The checkboxes on the left allows users to temporarily disable some
of the steps. Right-clicking on the rows shows options to remove a step.</p>

<h2>Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>The match terms&nbsp;column (last column) allows the user to enter
multiple
search terms, separated by tabs. You can enter ordination text or
regular expressions. For example: (\(C\d(2)\)) is able to match
text from (C00) to (C99), which is useful for organizing doujinshi.
Regular expressions requires a '* ' prefix (star followed by a space).
Regular expression is very powerful, and to
understand it fully&nbsp;please refer to the relevant
books or Internet resources.
</p>

<p>The copy step with the regular expression "* .*" is useful, because
it can copy the remaining text from the old file
name to the new file name. Some information in the
file names are not easy to treat (such as title and author names), so
by removing unnecessary text you can get the desired leftover text.</p>

<p>This application is using regular expression engine from Microsoft
.NET framework, therefore it only recognise that version of regular
expression syntax.</p>
